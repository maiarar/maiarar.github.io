[{"content":"My mind makes noise I don\u0026rsquo;t know if everyone knows, but I am autistic. And ADHD. And, from a more metaphysical perspective, I am a sensitive person (in short, someone who picks up thoughts from others, from this or other planes). This cauldron of thoughts, feelings, sensations, perceptions, intuitions, ideas, memories, and everything else that happens inside my mind is so intense that it tires me out too much.\nThe feeling is that my mind makes noise. And this noise is so loud that it tires, stresses, makes me anxious, causes physical malaise, makes me want to cry, scream, run away, hide, isolate myself, and often, makes me want to not exist.\nSometimes the tiredness starts with a poorly slept night. Sleep paralysis attacks, I am woken up several times during the night, and when I wake up, I am already tired. Usually, these nights are mixed with intense nightmares, the kind we feel relief from when we wake up. When this happens, I know my day will be heavy, and that the noise in my mind will be loud and I will need to double my efforts to deal with simple routine tasks.\nOther times, the tiredness is the hangover from a very intense day (usually the previous day), with excessive stimuli, noises, social interactions. In these moments, I know that these impacts will echo in my head for the following moments, and again I will have to dedicate myself to dealing with this chaos.\nWhat is most difficult, besides the mental chaos, is the difficulty that exists in explaining it to people. It reminds me a lot of the scene in \u0026ldquo;The Metamorphosis\u0026rdquo;, by Kafka, where Samsa, the protagonist, wakes up transformed into a giant insect, and has difficulty communicating with people, who do not understand what he says, or what he feels.\nHow to explain the noise in my mind to people? Excerpt from the book \u0026ldquo;The Metamorphosis\u0026rdquo;, by Franz Kafka: Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it was unmistakably his former voice, but in it there intruded, as if from below, an irrepressible and painful squeaking, which only at the first moment retained the literal clarity of the words, to destroy them in such a way when they had finished sounding that the person did not know if they had heard correctly\nI am not, today, in suffering like Samsa\u0026rsquo;s (protagonist of the book who deserved a review here just for him), but the difficulty of communication is something that bothers me a lot, and that occurs not only in moments of depression crises (as the book\u0026rsquo;s analogy, in my view, portrays). When the mind\u0026rsquo;s noise is loud, communication becomes difficult, and people don\u0026rsquo;t understand what I say, or what I feel. In this exchange with noises, we need to manage ourselves, our mind (which we are desperately trying to control), and people, who don\u0026rsquo;t understand (and often don\u0026rsquo;t want to understand).\nI know that the way to deal with this noise is self-care (bring on therapy, psychiatrist, drugs, meditation, conscious breathing, physical exercises, healthy eating, quality sleep\u0026hellip;). Self-care that is considered superfluous for most people, but for people like me, it is mandatory. However, understanding that no matter how much the variables are controlled, this chaos will return, is difficult, despite helping me prepare for it.\nIt will pass. Today was difficult, but tomorrow will be better. And the day after tomorrow, successively, until I get well again, and prepare for the next time the noise in my mind gets loud.\n","permalink":"https://maiarar.github.io/posts/2026-02-23-minha-mente-faz-barulho/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"my-mind-makes-noise\"\u003eMy mind makes noise\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know if everyone knows, but I am autistic.

With Open Finance, financial institutions gain access to customer relationship data with other institutions, which allows them to offer products better suited to each customer\u0026rsquo;s profile, as well as reducing credit analysis time and increasing transaction security.\nDifferences between Open Banking and Open Finance Open Finance is the expansion of Open Banking and the project\u0026rsquo;s name change. Now, not only information about traditional financial products is shared, but also information about investments, insurance, pensions, and more. However, all data security and privacy requirements remain the same, with the customer staying in control.\nWhat we can do today Currently, we can perform various operations thanks to Open Finance, such as:\nAccess to open data on financial products and services: information about interest rates, fees, credit limits, among others (without customer data). Sharing of registration and transactional data: if they wish, customers can request the sharing of data from accounts, investments, and insurance. It is possible to cancel sharing at any time. Payment transaction initiation: starting transactions (such as a PIX) directly within the desired financial institution\u0026rsquo;s app, facilitating payments in online stores. Open Finance also stimulates competition, which can lead to lower fees and an improved user experience, as they can view all their accounts in a single place.\nIn the future Through Open Finance, other innovations will be possible:\nInteroperability with Open Insurance: easier and faster access to insurance and pension products.

Combining this fact with our increasing need to solve problems, and the capitalism that commodifies most of the processes we are involved in, we always end up in a cycle of delivery. We need to deliver more. With more quality. In less time. And with less effort.\nDirectly, there is an impact on the automation of processes previously performed manually, and the software field is no exception. Obviously, with different peculiarities and specificities than in other areas, we see investments in tools that automate many functions—from building websites and apps to systems using only \u0026ldquo;drag and drop,\u0026rdquo; without needing any programming knowledge. This is without even entering the realm of artificial intelligence, where human influence may gradually decrease.\nBut does this matter beyond the IT field? This discussion, at first, seems to involve only those in the technology field. But we are all in the information society, with advances and involvements at a speed never before seen in human history.\nA joke that illustrates this well is comparing how the measure of a decade has become increasingly larger, just using our individual experiences. Compare what it was like to live in the 50s versus the 60s, the changes and technological advances that impacted people\u0026rsquo;s lives within those 10 years. And living in 2010 versus 2020? Was the impact the same?\nAnachronisms aside, is time passing faster, or are changes coming faster? Could you today, with your routine, live without any software acting in any part of your life?\nHow will we live in this world? Taking advantage of the decade comparison joke, it is frightening to imagine how many roles simply no longer exist. Switchboard operator, cinema usher, archivist, bowling pinsetter\u0026hellip; The list is long.\nAnd when we think about this, we think about the arrival of new technologies, and how the adaptation of us humans is put on the agenda.\nMany processes have become robotic, including the examples mentioned earlier; therefore, from this perspective, we need to adapt and (often) improve skills that escape this robotization/automation, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence.\nHowever, even remembering what Isaac Asimov said in the 50s in the book I, Robot, we long for a future where robots (whether humanoid or not) and humans coexist.\nMigrated post from Medium.

To which she replied, with total confusion:\nQA? Is that some kind of illegal scheme, or something you eat?\nWell, besides realizing my credibility with her is near zero, I also discovered that many people—including IT students—don\u0026rsquo;t really know what QA stands for. The goal of this post is to explain it within the tech world.\nThere might be some weird terms here for some of you. But relax! I’ll include context to make it easy to understand.\nYou reading and finally understanding QA / You judging my low-quality jokes.\nThe Concept of QA QA stands for \u0026ldquo;Quality Assurance.\u0026rdquo; So, when someone says they are a QA or work on a QA team, they are referring to the role of coordinating the quality assurance of a software product, usually within a development team.\nWhat Does Quality Involve? You know when you’re playing a game and weird things start happening? Or when your banking app just won\u0026rsquo;t cooperate and keeps freezing? Those are quality issues.\nAssuring quality involves caring about the user experience, keeping a sharp eye on the application\u0026rsquo;s functions, avoiding the famous bugs, monitoring speed, ensuring accessibility, and many other precautions.\nProper care would avoid sad situations, like the CyberPunk 2077 launch. 🤡\nWhat Does a QA Professional Actually Do? This person doesn\u0026rsquo;t just help guarantee quality; they help the team see improvements in delivery and processes. Their role often involves:\nDocumenting software requirements and what needs to be validated. Validating if planned processes for each area were executed. Testing if everything is working as expected (manual and automated tests). Programming automated tests to run in CI/CD pipelines. Rumor has it this is how a QA buys a bed.\nIs the QA Alone Responsible for Quality? No. Quality is the team\u0026rsquo;s responsibility. Everyone needs to be aware that their specific role impacts the final product. The QA professional provides support, bringing practices, analysis, and insights to lead this process.\nIn an agile team, for example, they can:\nSupport the PO in understanding requirements and writing stories. Help the UX designer with layout approvals. Create automated or manual test scenarios. Assist DevOps in integrating automated tests into the CI/CD flow. Is the Job Done Once the Product is Finished? Nope. After delivery, the end-user takes over. New feedback and unmapped bugs might surface, which is where the quality cycle begins all over again.\nPost migrated from Medium By Mai R. on May 14, 2021.

Little by little, I alternate between my inner self that wants to isolate, put on a silly animation to watch, just sleep and cry, and the self that wants to (re)act, wants to fight, wants to stop complaining about an unjust society without working to make it better.\nThe problem is that this self that fights and reacts is getting further away every day. It comes to me, sees how chaotic it is, how each news story overtakes the previous one and takes up space in my mind, and simply leaves, because there is no food, no energy, for me to keep it with me.\nI know we need detox moments, moments where you silence all social media, go play with your pet, make a nice dish in the kitchen, laugh (even remotely) with those you love. But then I start to think: what about those who don\u0026rsquo;t have a kitchen, or don\u0026rsquo;t have food? What about those who don\u0026rsquo;t have a home? What about those who are alone, with no one to talk to? How are these people doing? How can the world be so wrong to the point that these things and all other monstrosities exist and are considered normal?\nThe normal is what scares me the most. Inequalities are normalized, a eugenicist plan is normalized. And as much as people say otherwise, no, most people don\u0026rsquo;t think this is okay — but they have been forced into this type of normality (I hope).\nSome individuals, clinging to some faith, belief, or dogma (in this need to belong to a group as well), embrace the most incorrect and immoral ideas (thinking of Christian morality, so often babbled about out there), bringing them into the heart of the herd they belong to. Other individuals are simply numb, tired of being outraged; they just want their bills paid at the end of the month, to get that surgery scheduled at the public health system months ago, to manage to put food on the table, not to die from COVID-19.\nThis is the perfect soil. Perfect for incoherent and incorrect ideas to be disseminated, recorded, legislated, approved, and implemented. Institutions have been fragmented; things are not working correctly. And all this chaos is approved by that faithful base (approximately 30% of the people in this country, right?), ignored by those who want to maintain good mental health, and lived by all of us.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think this is normal. But I admit there are days when I simply forget reality, I feel bad, especially when imagining they can take the good things I\u0026rsquo;ve done for those I love, they can take the people I love. Who isn\u0026rsquo;t afraid of losing grandparents, parents, in these dark times, in this war? These are days of mourning. Where we don\u0026rsquo;t know when glory will come.\nWe only know that it will arrive. That one day, we will see again a world full of love, of joy. Hope is stronger than the nostalgia for days of glory. Despite insisting on keeping these positive feelings in me, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe everything is lost, that these terrible times are eternal. All things are cyclical, and something good will emerge after this darkness.\nWe continue a bit crippled, a bit wounded, but still walking. Today I only managed to write this text and cry. Tomorrow I will be able to have a meeting, draw a little, hug someone I love. One day at a time.\n\u0026ldquo;Today I am happy, I woke up on the right foot, and I will do it again, I will do it very well\u0026rdquo;\nI would like to give a special thanks to Teo e o Minimundo, who inspired me with this comic strip I placed throughout the text, and who touched me with their sensitivity and delicacy in dealing with such a difficult moment.\nAnd I wanted to thank you.

Indignation. Fear. Helplessness. It’s not hard to have felt one of these things — or all of them at once. In times of a pandemic, in this \u0026ldquo;war against the virus\u0026rdquo;, being in the trenches is difficult, it’s unbearable. But, until the war is over, how do we deal with it all?\nPhoto by K. Mitch Hodge on Unsplash\nThe ideal would be to have a responsible and mature Head of State, to consider science above any opinion. But the ideal doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist; what we can follow instead are strategies and tips to make things less difficult.\nStarting with taking care of our mental health. We know the gravity of what we are going through, how many people will die, how the State fails to fulfill its role, and how each of us suffers when losing a loved one. By constantly informing ourselves about this reality, we gradually poison ourselves and have our energy drained.\nIt is important to understand that we need moments to pause and take care of our minds. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s setting specific times to check the news (instead of searching for pandemic updates all day long) or taking an hour a day to do something pleasurable, the point is: we need to take care of ourselves, and seek moments of calm during the routine. Take care of yourself and those you love, first and foremost.\nPhoto by Eye for Ebony on Unsplash\nBy doing this, it becomes easier to engage in helping the current reality become better for everyone. There is no shortage of ways to do this! Get to know the initiatives happening in your community (independent groups, NGOs, etc.), and find out how to help! From donations to volunteer work, there’s plenty to do.\nHowever, holding government officials accountable cannot be left out. With a genocidal and eugenist president, every demand is necessary.\nComic strip by André Dahmer\nSince direct action is hindered by the pandemic, we have virtual actions as an alternative, by pressuring through emails and social media protests for bills to be approved or rejected. For example, we recently saw the postponement of the ENEM (national exam), which gained strength through social media pressure.\nAnother important thing is that \u0026ldquo;ant work\u0026rdquo; — spreading true news to the people you can reach — if you can, of course. You know that aunt who defends chloroquine? If you have the patience, talk to her, try to bring truth and facts to someone who, just like you, is afraid of what we are living through.\nAnyway, these are our tips and reflections on what we are experiencing. We hope you stay well, take care of yourselves, and keep up the fight with us 🌱🐑👊\nPost migrated from Medium By Mai R. on May 22, 2020.

In this article, I will briefly mention tools we use in the project I work on to improve our quality processes.\nContextualizing Testing The foundation for our strategy was the articles on Martin Fowler\u0026rsquo;s website, especially those focused on microservices architecture, which bring a new adaptation of the well-known Testing Pyramid.\nMore complete, right?\nIn this Pyramid:\nUnit tests test the smallest part of the software (that is testable) determining if the behavior is as expected, as we can read here. Integration tests verify interactions between internal and external components to detect any interface defects, which may involve a single component or several. We also have contract integration tests, which check if this contract meets what the consumer expects. Read more in this post. Component tests isolate components by replacing real interfaces with internal interfaces for testing, as explained in this topic. End-to-end tests (or Broad Stack Tests) verify if the system meets the requirements and achieves its objectives through end-to-end tests across the entire system. Exploratory tests are tests executed by a QA, manually exploring the system, looking for uncharted failures in other layers\u0026rsquo; tests and better educating the already automated tests. And how is our architecture? Our architecture is a microservices architecture, but using the query language GraphQL to expose and redirect most of the data.\nIf you want to know a bit more about how GraphQL can be used in a project, I strongly recommend reading a great article from the Netflix team detailing the learnings from its adoption, and the folks at GetNinjas also did a great post explaining how it fits into this architecture.\nTools and Processes for Each Layer Unit Tests As we deal with microservices in Java, in an MVC architecture, we utilize the range of possibilities that Spring offers us, along with the tools it has for unit and integration testing.\nIntegration and Component Tests For these tests, we are using the powerful Postman, created to test RESTful services, which can validate:\nEach integration through the testable interfaces in REST APIs and also through the calls of queries and mutations in the GraphQL engine. The complete functioning of each component, expecting that the response from the request is within the expected range. Today, Postman does not natively support fetching the GraphQL schema like its simpler and trendier competitor, Insomnia. However, changes are emerging, and it is starting to give competitors sleepless nights.\nEnd-to-End Tests For these tests, we use the famous Cucumber, with its implementation in Javascript. Every use case written with BDD is passed to it.\nHowever, with the growing number of use cases and the effort to maintain Cucumber, we are studying (and might use!) the simple and powerful Karate Framework, which combines “API test-automation, mocks and performance-testing into a single, unified framework,” creating a kind of DSL focused on HTTP, JSON, and XML — which is interesting for our scenario, especially with a very technical team. The folks at Hackernoon explain this better.\nhopefully the use of Karate will really eliminate the bugs in the code! However, in addition to REST and GraphQL APIs, the team I work with is also responsible for a web portal — and for automation with screens, nothing more classic than the mature Selenium. We are also starting to use Zalenium, which is scalable and allows parallel testing.\nExploratory Tests Who usually looks for errors, explores the software component, and creates creative tests while navigating through non-obvious scenarios? The QA! Obviously, they will only do this if the other types of tests are being covered in other tools, due to time and patience issues as well — after all, nothing is more exhausting for the QA than to require them to execute only tests that could be elaborated and automated in other layers.\nAnd our BDD? For BDD, we adapted the Three-meeting-friendly process for documentation review, which involves:\nThe Product Owner, writing the functional documentation, where the requirements of a specific API/resource will be explained and mapped. The Architect, writing the technical documentation with sequence diagrams and a good Swagger. The QA, who will analyze these documents and write the BDDs. We Encountered New Challenges in the Process We are currently building a QA environment so that tests can be executed separately from other environments (without overloading the dev environment). We still need to improve how to bring test reports and metrics into the daily lives of developers; ideas ranging from having a TV that displays the builds that broke (in tests) to having a “test manager” have emerged, but we are still aligning the best path. Performance testing has not yet entered our CI/CD and development process — another novelty that is on our roadmap! Well, I would like to have shared with you a bit of what was needed to deal with quality processes for microservices architectures.\nThanks to Guilherme Machado Rogatto, who reminded me to mention Zelenium :)\nI hope I have helped!\nBest regards!\nPost migrated from Medium.
