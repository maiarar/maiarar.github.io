I am a QA professional with a strong inclination towards Backend development (I lean more towards SDET) and passionate about architecting solutions that ensure software quality and efficiency.\nHere you will find my projects, study records, and reflections on technology and society.\nAbout Me I am a person driven by curiosity and continuous learning, and I believe that technology should be a tool for positive transformation in society, always with a critical and ethical perspective.\nAfter a long time procrastinating, I decided to create this blog to share my experiences, learnings, and projects. For me, sharing knowledge is a two-way street: teaching is the best way to learn, and the diversity of perspectives is what truly enriches our vision, whether in technology or in life.\nJourney and Technology Graduated since 2019, I have been part of the technology ecosystem since my undergraduate studies. My experience centers around:\nSoftware Quality (SDET): planning, execution, and automation of tests Backend Development: building robust and scalable systems Observability and Processes: implementing metrics and detailed technical documentation Currently, I focus my studies and projects on SDET and Backend, consolidating my portfolio through this blog and technical contributions. I have experience with complex tools (like Salesforce Marketing Cloud) and an analytical perspective aimed at solving end-to-end problems.\nCommunity and Impact I believe in the power of the collective. I am a member of Cantinho das QAs, a community focused on empowering women in the quality field, and I have spoken at events like TDC.\nMy commitment to social causes is part of who I am:\nMentorship: I serve as a mentor at ADPList, helping new individuals navigate their paths in technology. Education: I have been a student, mentor, and teacher at {re}programa, focusing on digital inclusion. Volunteering: I collaborate with local initiatives in Campinas, such as CEAK and local support projects. Let\u0026rsquo;s Talk? If you want to chat about technology, knowledge management, or opportunities in SDET and Backend, feel free to say hi! I am always open to connections, collaborations, and new friendships.\n","permalink":"https://maiarar.github.io/posts/2026-02-20-personal-presentation/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"hello-welcome-to-my-digital-space-\"\u003eHello, welcome to my digital space! 🌿\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is \u003cstrong\u003eMaiara Rodrigues\u003c/strong\u003e.
